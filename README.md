# File Management API using Node.js

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a simple file management API using Node.js. The API allows users to upload, list, and delete files. Additionally, it implements file categorization functionality.

## Requirements

### Code Structuring

- Organize the project into appropriate directories and files.
- Implement a clear folder structure for routes, controllers, and utilities.
- Follow a consistent naming convention.

### Optimization

- Implement file upload and deletion efficiently.
- Minimize unnecessary code execution.
- Utilize async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Utilize caching mechanisms for improved performance.
- Handle errors gracefully.

### Responsibility Division

- Divide the application into well-defined and reusable modules.
- Implement SOLID principles for better maintainability.
- Use Dependency Injection for loose coupling.

### Architecture

- Define a clear architecture for the application (e.g., routing, controllers).
- Use middleware for common functionalities (e.g., error handling, logging).

### Data Flow

- Ensure a unidirectional data flow within the application.
- Use advanced serialization techniques for efficient data exchange.
- Implement streaming for large file operations.

### Data Storage

- Store file data in a local directory.
- Implement basic server-side storage for user's file data.
- Implement data encryption for sensitive information.

### Latest Tools and Libraries

- Use the latest stable version of Node.js.
- Implement routing using Express.js.
- Utilize a middleware for handling file uploads (e.g., multer).

### Bonus

- Implement file versioning.
- Add authentication for API endpoints.
- Implement file search functionality.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-management-api.git

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd file-management-api
   npm install

3. Set up environment variables:
  Create a .env file and add the following variables:
  
  ```bash
  PORT=
  UPLOADS_DIRECTORY= 
  SECRET_KEY= 
  MONGO_URL=

4. Run the application:
  ```bash
  npm start

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
